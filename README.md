# Blockchain - Basic Project 1

This is our **real** repository for our blockchain program.

## Plan for feature implementations

* Incorporate tasks solutions from Sune's exercises.
* Implement consensus algorithm. For now, this will be PoW.
* Implement P2P communication between 2 computers. If this turns out to be unfeasible, we'll instead go with communication between kernels.

## Work ethics in this repo

Every commit must have a meaningful header. We'll all be reading what you've committed and why, so make it easy to understand what it is. Also, avoid committing too much stuff, especially if it's not useful. It's not a **huge** deal, but keeping the repo history less cluttered is nice.

When you want to implement a new feature or fix a bug, publish a new branch for that. When you're done and have nothing else to add for that particular implementation, open a pull request and request a code review from everyone else. Why? Since all of us own this project, it's fair to ensure everyone have approved the code before submitting it to the main branch.

The "issues"-tab: It's for coding to-do's, any specific coding issue you may have or a bug you encountered that you're either fixing or want someone else to fix. There are not restraints on creating these as long as they serve a purpose. Try to use the tags and assigning of members whenever it's relevant.

Below is an example of how an issue-post can help keep track of bugs and if they're fixed, how, and when.
